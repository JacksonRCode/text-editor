    TCSAFLUSH specifies when to apply change:
    Here it waits for all pending output to be 
    written to the terminal and discards any input
    that hasn't been read

    ICANON flag allows us to turn off canonical mode
    which means we can read input byte-by-byte instead of line-by-line

    tcsetattr() applies changes to terminal

    // Echo stops us from seeing keystrokes and ICANON reads bit by bit
    ICANON is not an input flag, it is a local flag in the c_lflag field
